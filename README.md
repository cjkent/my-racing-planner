## Scripts for Data Fetching

The project includes scripts to fetch data from iRacing's public API and parse it into JSON files. These scripts require valid iRacing credentials in the `.env` file.

### Fetching Data

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your iRacing API credentials:

   ```env
   IRACING_USERNAME=your_username
   IRACING_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

2. Run the fetch script:

   ```bash
   pnpm run fetch-data
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm run fetch-past
   ```

3. Process the fetched data into parsed JSON files:

   ```bash
   pnpm run parse-data
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm run parse-past
   ```

Copy the content of `ir-api/parsed/` folder into `src/ir-data/` folder. The generated JSON files will be used to populate the application's content.
